Today, I'm thrilled to dive into the topic of data lakehouses. I'm incredibly curious about this subject and excited to share some thoughts with you. Let's delve in!"
# Data Lakehouse and The mysteries of them

![[meme-data-lakehouse.png|center]]

**Data Lakehouse** is one of the heck things in data world, no doubt, it make you become curious with the the complex of them from definition to techstack, a new category to tackle and many keywords need to explore. I wonder to see it growth up in next future, but luckily for me for have a chance to approach and build one of them for my work

As usual, before go to build the something, I will go to the definition of them first, and I want share more my perspective of them
## Data Lakehouse

Following the idea of my colleague, Shout out to [Anh Nhan Phan - AI Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhan-phan-van-b814b223a/), he want me to build the first lakehouse and use it for managing and conquer the worthy data. You can try to explore more about the Lakehouse and related topics via these contents

><h2>Data Lakehouse</h2>
>
>Data Lakehouse is a new data management architecture combination the flexible, scale and cost-efficiency of data lake with powered structured and [ACID](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/acid-transactions) strategies of Data Warehouse

With the information of these blogs, Data Lakehouse will help you managing any types structure of data with easy taking with query. It's hard for you get their future if you keep on track with trandition data-warehouse and not doubt, it's really complicated somehow.

Lakehouse will leverage in object storage like (S3, Azure Storage Account or HDFS), up to you to choose what compatible for your business. it built the data to become small layer and save them in new types, like [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) or [ORC](https://orc.apache.org/), it's truly optimize, fast and more efficiency with new query engine.

Therefore summaries about Lakehouse, we will have a couple of valaues, such as

- **Unified Architecture** - Built on object storage but able to analysis structure data
- **ACID Transaction** - Offered transaction guarantees
- **Schema-on-read/write with ACID transactions**
- **Scalable, cost-efficient storage**

Over them, when you adapt Lakehouse, you will

- Add the metadata layer for data lakes
- Optimize and with compatible with many new query engine, designed for high-performance SQL
- Optimize and able to ease approaching for Data Science and Machine Learning

When we talk about Lakehouse, you will approach to couple of candidates which will become more popular nowadays, such as

- [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/)
- [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/)
- [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/)
- [Apache Paimon](https://paimon.apache.org/)

##  Lakehouse is evolving really fast

</div>

Here are the reasons why many companies are choosing to adopt or apply the lakehouse architecture for their business:

- The combination of features from data lakes and data warehouses transforms the lakehouse into a general system for data control, helping to centralize data in one place without needing to access multiple systems.
- It also builds and provides a robust solution for machine learning and data science workloads.
- Key attributes of this architecture that help achieve business objectives include its ability to enforce complex schemas and support ACID transactions, a significant benefit traditionally associated with data warehouses.

While Data Lakehouse architectures offer compelling advantages, it's crucial to consider whether they genuinely align with your business needs and operational maturity. There are several reasons why a Lakehouse might not be the immediate "silver bullet":

- **Complexity in Operation and Management:** The Lakehouse architecture is inherently complex, integrating multiple components and demanding sophisticated management. While ideal for research into performance, deploying it in production inherently carries significant risks due to this complexity.
- **Early Stage Technology:** The Lakehouse concept is still in its nascent stages. This means the architecture is continuously evolving, and significant changes or new developments could potentially break existing systems, necessitating careful and deliberate adoption.
- **Documentation and Hidden Nuances:** The documentation for tools like [Polaris](https://polaris.apache.org/) and [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) can be extensive and complex. There are often many hidden details and subtle techniques required to get these tools working optimally, demanding a high level of technical expertise and significant effort to explore and implement successfully. It's not always easy for a first-time implementer.

Following the [Open Source Data Engineering Landscape 2025](https://www.pracdata.io/p/open-source-data-engineering-landscape-2025) by [Alireza Sadeghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alirezasadeghi/), Data Lake Platforms, particularly with the growth of `Iceberg` and [Open Table Formats](https://www.starburst.io/blog/open-table-formats/), have undoubtedly become a sizzling and significant topic in data engineering. I've had the honor and pleasure of witnessing and contributing to this work in a business context.
## Metadata and Catalog nurturing the lakehouse

![[thumbnail-iceberg-catalog.png]]

Going a bit deeper into the Data Lakehouse, especially with `Iceberg`, you'll frequently encounter the concepts of the **Metadata Layer** and **Data Catalog**. These might seem simple on the surface, but understanding them is crucial for learning about and successfully building your Data Lakehouse.

Let's explore some key information via these articles before I offer my own explanation

- [AWS - Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/best-practices-building-data-lake-for-games/data-cataloging.html)
- [Medium - Data Catalogs and metadata management](https://medium.com/@kwtrelbakouri1/data-catalogs-and-metadata-management-ffe43e8ddb59)
- [LakeFS  - Apache Iceberg Catalogs: Types & How to Choose the Right Catalog](https://lakefs.io/blog/iceberg-catalog/)
- [Medium - Iceberg Catalogs: A Guide for Data Engineers](https://medium.com/itversity/iceberg-catalogs-a-guide-for-data-engineers-a6190c7bf381)
- [Onehouse - Comprehensive Data Catalog Comparison](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/comprehensive-data-catalog-comparison) ðŸŒŸ **(Recommended)**
- [IceBerg - REST Catalog Spec](https://iceberg.apache.org/rest-catalog-spec/)

>[!info]
><h2>Metadata Layer</h2>
>
>Metadata Layer is an abstraction layer built on top of your raw data files, e.g Parquet in Cloud Storage like S3 Bucket. It's a structured way of organizing and managing your data within the data lake

`Iceberg` specifically, and Lakehouse architectures in general, leverage a **metadata layer for table versioning**. This means that any change in the data layer, such as **appends, updates, deletes, or schema edits**, will result in the creation of a **new snapshot of your table's state**.

>[!info]
><h2>Data Catalog</h2>
>
>Data Catalog is an organized inventory of data assets within an organization. It helps users discover, understand, and manage the data available for use. A data catalog typically includes metadata combined with data discovery and management tools, and it provides an inventory of data assets across all your data sources.

Leveraging a Data Catalog provides several key advantages:

- **Data Discovery and Exploration**: It allows users to quickly find, understand, and explore available data assets across an organization.
- **Data Governance - Access Control**: It aids in implementing and enforcing access policies, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify specific datasets.
- **Data Governance - Compliance**: It helps organizations meet regulatory requirements (like GDPR, HIPAA) by tracking data usage, lineage, and ensuring data privacy.
- **Data Lineage and Documentation**: It provides a clear view of where data comes from, how it's transformed, and where it goes, along with comprehensive documentation about its meaning and quality.
- **Data Quality Management**: It supports efforts to monitor and improve data quality by providing insights into data health, identifying anomalies, and tracking quality metrics.

>[!quote]
>Understanding these two layers is fundamental to grasping how Iceberg provides data warehousing capabilities on top of cost-effective data lake storage, making it a cornerstone of the modern data lakehouse.

I truly recommend starting your Lakehouse journey with `Iceberg`. It offers a robust ecosystem with generally good instructions (though sometimes they can be a bit scattered ðŸ˜„) and numerous tools built specifically for it, representing the next generation for achieving greater efficiency in the data world

- **Hadoop Catalog:** This is a file-based catalog that stores metadata directly in a file system (like HDFS or S3). It's simple to set up, ideal for development, and works across various file systems, but it's not typically recommended for high-concurrency production environments.
- **Hive Catalog:** This option leverages an existing Hive Metastore to manage metadata. It's highly compatible with existing big data tools and is cloud-agnostic, making it a popular choice in environments already using Hive.
- **AWS Glue Catalog:** A fully managed, serverless catalog provided by AWS. It's perfect for organizations deeply integrated into the AWS ecosystem, offering seamless integration with other AWS services.
- **Nessie Catalog:** This provides Git-like version control semantics for your data. It allows for branching, merging, and rolling back data tables, bringing "data as code" principles to the data lakehouse.
- **JDBC Catalog:** This catalog uses any relational database (via JDBC) as its backend to store the metadata pointers, offering a flexible option for integration with existing database infrastructure.
- **REST Catalog:** A modern, language-agnostic catalog specification that allows clients to interact with a centralized catalog service via REST APIs. This promotes interoperability across diverse programming languages and engines, as the catalog logic is centralized (e.g., Apache Polaris is a REST Catalog implementation).

In my opinion and my experience, you can try to experiment couple tech-stack for Lakehouse like

1. **Iceberg + MinIO + Polaris + Trino/Spark (My Choice ðŸŒŸ)**
    
    - This stack leverages a REST Catalog with Polaris, supporting the creation of more secure data lakehouse systems with pre-defined RBAC.
    - It is considered a complex stack to operate and is still actively under development, sometimes not rating as highly as other options in terms of maturity.
        
2. **Apache Hudi + S3/ADLS/GCS + Apache Flink + Trino/Spark**:
    
    - This stack is designed to meet strong real-time requirements, focusing on frequent data modifications, hybrid workloads, and fine-grained control over data.
        
3. **Delta Lake + Databricks Lakehouse Platform (Managed Cloud-Native)**:
    
    - This is the preferred choice when you prioritize a highly integrated, managed platform with a strong emphasis on MLOps.
    - It offers simplified development through Delta Live Tables (DLT) and is ideal if you prefer a single vendor for a significant portion of your data platform.

# Build The First Lakehouse

![[meme-data-engineer.png|center]]

Like I related above, I choose techstack, include  **Iceberg + MinIO + Polaris + Trino/Spark** for my first lakehouse. Why I choose that because two reason

- First off, a big shout-out to my colleague [Anh Nhan Phan - AI Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhan-phan-van-b814b223a/), who encouraged me to pursue this stack, and it's been a great experience.
- Second, this stack aligns with how Netflix built their successful Data Lakehouse, as shared by their engineers at an AWS conference, which is truly inspiring.


<div align="center">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jMFMEk8jFu8?si=ilNgoznWRL8HV1WC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

- Third one, this stack is not new and it's totally had many experience engineers write about that, such as

	- [Medium - Build a Data Lakehouse with Apache Iceberg, Polaris, Trino & MinIO](https://medium.com/@gilles.philippart/build-a-data-lakehouse-with-apache-iceberg-polaris-trino-minio-349c534ecd98) ðŸŒŸ **(Recommended)**

	- [Dremio - Getting Hands-on with Polaris OSS, Apache Iceberg and Apache Spark](https://www.dremio.com/blog/getting-hands-on-with-polaris-oss-apache-iceberg-and-apache-spark/)

![[thumbnail-polaris-lakehouse.png]]

## The vision and conclude of mine

This stack is genuinely challenging due to its high complexity, and you're likely to encounter several problems:
- **Limited Polaris Documentation:** As an incubating project, Polaris's documentation for configuration is not yet fully comprehensive. This makes it a very tough choice for newcomers.
- **Spark's Complexity:** Spark, despite being a powerful query engine, is complex to manage, especially concerning its multiple versions and required packages. It can be uncomfortable to work with without significant experience.
- **Lack of REST Catalog Resources:** There aren't many detailed blogs or resources explaining Polaris's REST Catalog, and many organizations haven't rated Polaris highly recently.
        
However, if you are able to adapt to and master this stack, it will lead to a truly satisfying and unique experience. If I discover any helpful tips during setup, I'll be sure to note them for you.

Before you begin, always remember to consult the official documentation and source code:

- [Polaris - Documentation v1.0.0](https://polaris.apache.org/releases/1.0.0/) and [GitHub - Polaris v1.0.0](https://github.com/apache/polaris/tree/release/1.0.x)        
- [Iceberg - Documentation about Spark](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-getting-started/)
- [GitHub - docker-spark-iceberg](https://github.com/databricks/docker-spark-iceberg)
## Setup the environment

>[!quote]
>Following documentations and articles, I learn a lot about this stack from configuration, best practice and what challenge of them encountered when operate them. But I just complete a haft journey to build and operate them in Docker Environment, BTW, the production uses Kubernetes and i will try release another one when it already in production and able to work as expectation

Prerequisite installed for starting

- Docker: v27.5.1
- Docker Compose: v2.34.0

You can find more about how to setup at [[Awesome Docker CLI#Installing|Awesome Docker CLI>Installing]]

>[!note]
>I strongly recommend using `docker-compose` at least version 2.34 or 2.3.x, as some functionalities, particularly [depends_on with conditions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/startup-order/), are implemented only in these versions, and older versions may lead to failures.

After you finish setup `docker` and `docker-compose`, here is structure of project you need to build

```bash
data-lakehouse
â”œâ”€â”€ conf
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ spark
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ spark-default.conf
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ .dockerignore

```

This is entire `docker-compose` to setup full stack Polaris, IceBerg and Spark, so here is key feature of my `docker-compose`

- For cost efficiency and local development, [MinIO](https://www.min.io/) is a great option to choose but you can choose other option with [LocalStack S3](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/services/s3/), both of them is S3 Platform and work as S3 compatible, where is data layer to keep your data in action of `IceBerg`. You will have `minio-client` build parallel for first time to automatically setup bucket
- Next, Polaris, it will contain entire configuration to build the production version of Polaris with [MetaStore](https://polaris.apache.org/releases/1.0.0/configuring-polaris-for-production/#metastore-configuration) to keep the information like RBAC, Bootstrap, ... Read and explore more at [Configuring Polaris for Production](https://polaris.apache.org/releases/1.0.0/configuring-polaris-for-production/) **(NOTE: This Polaris still doesn't serve OAuth2 and realm header, you can activate it but still not big deal in development environment)**
- About Spark, I choose the image `tabulario/spark-iceberg:latest` which build on the good environment, not latest but use **stable version of IceBerg v1.9.2 and Spark v3.5.5**, explore more about this image at [GitHub - Dockefile](https://github.com/databricks/docker-spark-iceberg/blob/main/spark/Dockerfile)
- Database PostgreSQL for keep entities of Polaris, it's truly important to save bootstrap and metadata for query, which one provide good behavior for Polaris. DB will base on [Quarkus Framework](https://quarkus.io/guides/datasource) to setup datasource and when you configure it, it will try to bootstrap at your DB with **schema: `polaris_schema`**
- The last one, Polaris Bootstrap, this is really important to let your Polaris work because if not will miss the Realm and Root account for operating successfully. You should read more at [Admin Tool](https://polaris.apache.org/releases/1.0.0/admin-tool/) to know what need to do. **(NOTE: I truly forgot to read this and you know why it work because I try and find the [Schema V1](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/release/1.0.x/persistence/relational-jdbc/src/main/resources/postgres/schema-v1.sql) with the bootstrap via admin tool by [Docker Image](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/release/1.0.x/getting-started/jdbc/docker-compose-bootstrap-db.yml))**. Therefore, I actual finish to setup the techstack in Docker Compose

Next we will turn it up with step by step below

First of all, we need to bring up DB and Bootstrap first for creating schema and migration which thing to provide for Polaris to use when it up

```bash
docker compose up -d db polaris-bootstrap
```

>[!note]
>With `polaris-bootstrap`, I already set the `depends_on` condition for them for starting because there have time boot DB and Healthcheck, so it can let your `polaris-bootstrap` encounter fail so why I write it

```yaml {12-15}
  polaris-bootstrap:
    image: apache/polaris-admin-tool:latest
    environment:
      POLARIS_PERSISTENCE_TYPE: relational-jdbc
      QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL: jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/polaris
      QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: postgres
      QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: postgres
    command:
      - "bootstrap"
      - "--realm=polaris"
      - "--credential=polaris,root,secret"
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
        restart: true
    networks:
      - lakehouse_net
```

Now your DB will ready to use for `Polaris`, you can try to more check up when bootstrap finished and completed

```bash {9}
docker compose exec -it db psql -U postgres -d polaris -c "SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;"

    schema_name     
--------------------
 pg_toast
 pg_catalog
 public
 information_schema
 polaris_schema
(5 rows)
```

If you see `polaris_schema` in your DB, it's totally fine to use with `polaris`

Next, you will bring up the other stack in docker-compose, include: `polaris`, `spark`, `minio` and `minio-client`

>[!note]
>`minio-client` should run for first time to bootstrap your MinIO and in next time this one should be ignored

```bash
# Create the notebooks for saving your code in spark
mkdir -p notebooks

# Run and setup the fully compose
docker compose up -d minio minio-client polaris spark-iceberg
```

Now, you can run the script to fully setup catalog for your REALM in Polaris, including

- Catalog
- Principle
- Principle Role

You can use my script - inspired by [Gilles Philippart](https://medium.com/@gilles.philippart) to build the script for completely workaround with API of Polaris, See the explanation at [Medium - Build a Data Lakehouse with Apache Iceberg, Polaris, Trino & MinIO](https://medium.com/@gilles.philippart/build-a-data-lakehouse-with-apache-iceberg-polaris-trino-minio-349c534ecd98).

```

After that trigger the script

```bash
bash ./scripts/setup-catalog.sh
```

You can watch the log of `Polaris` to see what things happen inside Polaris REST HTTP will trigger inside, it will help you get information or track the exception.

```bash
docker compose logs -f polaris
```

Now you already completely setup the Polaris, Spark and IceBerg with MinIO. Next time, when you want to turn back to stack at savepoint, you just need to use

```bash
docker compose up -d db minio polaris spark-iceberg
```

## Playaround with Spark

![[meme-spark.png|center]]

Honestly, this part is one I struggle, because you know `spark` which includes many configuration and no generic documentation write about this one work with IceBerg and S3 Customization like MinIO. I cost 2 days to figure out and found it. Before that let's take a look about configuration from [IceBerg Page](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-configuration/)

I try to write that into scripts and conf to use, let see

```toml title="./conf/spark/spark-default.conf"
# Spark configuration for Iceberg and MinIO (S3-compatible)

# Iceberg Catalog Configuration (to use Polaris)
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.type= rest
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.uri=http://polaris:8181/api/catalog # Polaris endpoint
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.warehouse=polariscatalog # Warehouse location
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.io-impl=org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO # For S3/MinIO
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.endpoint=http://minio:9000 # MinIO S3 endpoint
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.access-key=admin
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.secret-key=password
spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.path-style-access=true # Crucial for MinIO compatibility

# Ensure Spark can interact with S3-compatible storage
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint=http://minio:9000
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key=admin
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key=password
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled=false # Set to true if using HTTPS for MinIO
```

I doesn't know work or not but I give a try and it cause a lot of exception, so why I exchange into second option use via command, and `spark-sql` is one tool able interact in terminal

```bash title="./script/run-spark-sql.sh"
#!/bin/bash

# start Spark SQL client shell
docker compose exec -it spark-iceberg spark-sql  \
    --packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.9.2,org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-aws-bundle:1.9.2 \
    --conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions \
    --conf spark.sql.defaultCatalog=polariscatalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.type=rest \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.io-impl=org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.uri=http://polaris:8181/api/catalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.warehouse=polariscatalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.credential='root:secret' \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.scope='PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL' \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.token-refresh-enabled=true \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.endpoint=http://minio:9000 \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.access-key=admin \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.secret-key=password \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polariscatalog.s3.path-style-access=true \
    --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint=http://minio:9000 \
    --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key=admin \
    --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key=password \
    --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true \
    --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem \
    --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled=false
```

The script is completely version of `spark-default.conf` and when you trigger 

```bash
bash ./scripts/run-spark-sql.sh
```

It will success connect your terminal into `spark-sql` and now you can run a couple query in catalog

```sql
# Create NameSpace in your Catalog, DB is your namespace
CREATE NAMESPACE IF NOT EXISTS polariscatalog.db;

# Create Table names inside DB Namespace
CREATE TABLE polariscatalog.db.names (name STRING) USING iceberg;

# Insert Data into that Namespaces
INSERT INTO polariscatalog.db.names VALUES ('Xeus Nguyen'), ('Nhan Phan');

# Select the data in this catalog
SELECT * FROM polariscatalog.db.names;
```

Your data will save at location **warehouse (catalog) > db (namespace) > names (table)**

![[Pasted image 20250816223012.png]]

With `data`, it will save in `Parquet` format

![[Pasted image 20250816223211.png]]

With `metadata`, it will save in `json` and `avro` format
