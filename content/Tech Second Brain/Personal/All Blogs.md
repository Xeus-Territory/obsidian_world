# InfoSec & Security

## CTF

>[!info]
>As you know from my profile, I started my journey as a **CTF player and Web Pentester**. CTFs, a field of competitive games and contests, were where I gained invaluable experience and truly found my footing in security. In this session, I'll walk you through a challenge that required significant research to find the flag—it's genuinely interesting and won't waste your time.

- [Hackwekend - Session 1 (Pentester web - Security Lab)](https://hackmd.io/@XeusNguyen/S1udpmwro) - *About the vulnerable machine is take a look and gain access to collecting flag (CTF)*
- [Hackwekend Session 2 - Information Security, Team and Phishing Attack](https://hackmd.io/@XeusNguyen/ryHkhL-e2) - *The session talk about what and why we have InfoSec and work like a team. Additional, Talk about Phishing Attack, Questions and how to reproduce*
- [Hackwekend - Session 3 Attack and Exploit GraphQL ?](https://hackmd.io/@XeusNguyen/rJ0j0WR-p) - *Session is about GraphQL, Dangerous with technologies and some challenge to find flag with CTF style*
- [Hackwekend Session 4 - Cloud Security (AWS EKS)](https://hackmd.io/@XeusNguyen/H1sUc3CB6) *- Session is about AWS EKS Security, Vulnerable in K8s Cluster and Play CTF to figuring out what should need protected (EKS Cluster Game prod by Wiz.io)*
- [Hackwekend Session 5 - Cloud Security (AWS IAM Policy)](https://hackmd.io/@XeusNguyen/HkjGUFw-C) - *Session is about AWS IAM, How to authentication or bypass methodology to read and list contents inside the S3 bucket, learn more about `sns`, `sqs`, `cognito` services of AWS Cloud (Big IAM prod by Wiz.io)*
- [Hackwekend Session 6 - Cloud Security (Network and Red Team)](https://hackmd.io/@XeusNguyen/ByLqkK1zC) *- Session is about more than cloud security, but more approach to networking and red team methodology to recon, attack the target with unique way like `lateral movement`, `nfs`, `tcpdump`, `dnscan` and `istio`, `kyverno` on `kubernetes` ( K8slan prod by Wiz.io)*

# Kubewekend Series

>[!info]
>Brand new series about `kubernetes`, and it will release at least one time a week on the weekend. On this session, I will share about `kubernetes`, `networking`, `devsecops` and moreover, It will give you idea, and practice environment to understand many new technologies. Try best and have fun with me 🙌🙌🙌

**Timeline: July 2024 - Current**
## 2024

- [[Kubewekend Session 1|Kubewekend Session 1: Build up your host with Vagrant]] - *This lab is take the topic around play and practice with `vagrant` - the software can help you provide the virtual machine in your host. First step way to setup `kubernetes` cluster inside your machine, and play with on next session*
- [[Kubewekend Session 2|Kubewekend Session 2: Setup Kind cluster with Ansible]] - *This lab is practice with `ansible` the configuration for setup `kind` cluster inside machine on the previous session*
- [[Kubewekend Session 3|Kubewekend Session 3: Basically about Kubernetes architecture]] - *This session talk about basically architecture and learn more fundamental components inside `kubernetes`, and what the structure of them inside clusters.*
- [[Kubewekend Session 4|Kubewekend Session 4: Learn about ebpf with hubble and cilium]] - *This session will talk and learn about `eBPF` and the especially representation of `eBPF` are `cilium` and `hubble` to become main CNI of Kubewekend and talk about Observability of them*
- [[Kubewekend Session 5|Kubewekend Session 5: Build HA Cluster]] - This session is really pleasant when we talk about how can create HA cluster with `kubewekend`, learn more the components inside `kubernetes` and try figure out about `network`, `security`, `configuration`, `container runtime` and `system` via this session
- [[Kubewekend Session 6|Kubewekend Session 6: CSI and Ceph with Kubewekend]] - This session is covered about topic storage inside `Kubernetes` cluster, how can they work with `CSI` Architecture and why we need to `CSI Driver` for handle this stuff. Furthermore, I try to practice with `Ceph` - one of popular storage opensource for `Kubewekend` cluster
## 2025

- [[Kubewekend Session Extra 1|Kubewekend Session Extra 1: Longhorn and the story about NFS in Kubernetes]] - This lab is try to take you to journey to learn about new CSI for Kubernetes, `Longhorn` and deliver you to new method to handle transfer large file via network by NFS protocol. I also provide more information about `iSCSI`, `nfs-ganesha` and technique `rdma`
- [[Kubewekend Session Extra 2|Kubewekend Session Extra 2: Rebuild Cluster with RKE2 or K3S]] - This article aims to provide you with insights into alternatives for self-hosting a full Kubernetes cluster. Both `K3s` and `RKE2` are strong contenders worth considering to guide your decision. Focusing on the self-hosted approach with `RKE2`, I want to share more about my experiences working with it over the past four months.
# Tech Research (What is)
