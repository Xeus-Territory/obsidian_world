# Kubewekend Series

>[!info]
>Brand new series about `kubernetes`, and it will release at least one time a week on the weekend. On this session, I will share about `kubernetes`, `networking`, `devsecops` and moreover, It will give you idea, and practice environment to understand many new technologies. Try best and have fun with me 🙌🙌🙌

## 2024

- [[Kubewekend Session 1|Kubewekend Session 1: Build up your host with Vagrant]] - *This lab is take the topic around play and practice with `vagrant` - the software can help you provide the virtual machine in your host. First step way to setup `kubernetes` cluster inside your machine, and play with on next session*
- [[Kubewekend Session 2|Kubewekend Session 2: Setup Kind cluster with Ansible]] - *This lab is practice with `ansible` the configuration for setup `kind` cluster inside machine on the previous session*
- [[Kubewekend Session 3|Kubewekend Session 3: Basically about Kubernetes architecture]] - *This session talk about basically architecture and learn more fundamental components inside `kubernetes`, and what the structure of them inside clusters.*

- [[Kubewekend Session 5|Kubewekend Session 5: Build HA Cluster]] - This session is really pleasant when we talk about how can create HA cluster with `kubewekend`, learn more the components inside `kubernetes` and try figure out about `network`, `security`, `configuration`, `container runtime` and `system` via this session
- [[Kubewekend Session 6|Kubewekend Session 6: CSI and Ceph with Kubewekend]] - This session is covered about topic storage inside `Kubernetes` cluster, how can they work with `CSI` Architecture and why we need to `CSI Driver` for handle this stuff. Furthermore, I try to practice with `Ceph` - one of popular storage opensource for `Kubewekend` cluster
