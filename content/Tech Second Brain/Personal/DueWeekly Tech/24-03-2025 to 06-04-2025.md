# Architecture

[1. Blog - System Design was HARD until I Learned these 30 Concepts](https://blog.algomaster.io/p/30-system-design-concepts)

- The brief of popular concepts in technologies, if you want to prepare the interview, learn about bare concept and approach a new things what you want to explore about system design or system architecture, so this blog is one spent for y'all guys.
- It sets the information, show case and explain why you should use once of these concept for your implementation.

[2. Blog - Hardware-Aware Coding: CPU Architecture Concepts Every Developer Should Know (Insane Blog)](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/hardware-aware-coding) 

- This blog cover about there popular of architecture of CPU, with cool illustrator and friendly explain
- Author want to *"Along with exploration of these techniques, we will also look at multiple concrete code examples to understand how to apply this knowledge to optimize code performance"*
- Via Blog, Author want us to know more the how process work with your writing code, it doesn't mean you write code with good behavior, it means you can control and understand how hardware align to process your high-level code. It's tugh for sure.

[3. Medium - 15 GitOps Best Practices to Improve Your Workflows](https://medium.com/spacelift/15-gitops-best-practices-to-improve-your-workflows-50daaf98ba6e)

[4. Medium - ðŸš€ Master GitOps: Deploy Helm Charts with ArgoCD & Flux Like a Pro!](https://medium.com/devops-techable/master-gitops-deploy-helm-charts-with-argocd-flux-like-a-pro-66de1d5e39e6)

- Article of [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/) show us how to apply GitOps in good way and behavior, You choose GitOps for your project, product, so you should learn how to use this strategies in good ways. Don't mess up, keep it clean and you can show the efficiency with GitOps.
- Moreover, With GitOps and Kubernetes, you will work a lot with two tools and I think that truly popular idea than another candidate, `Argo` and `Flux`, both of them are great and have different way to use. But the second articles let us know about how combination with `Argo` and `Flux` to create wonderful solution, base infrastructure and developer behavior with Kubernetes Helm Chart.
- Read more about feature of [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/) and [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), both of them have more things than CD only, double-check and you can find more what you need

[5. Medium - Why Uber Moved from Postgres to MySQL](https://medium.com/databases-in-simple-words/why-uber-moved-from-postgres-to-mysql-b6ecfa9ff0d9)

- This articles show us how Uber deal to exchange from `PostgreSQL` to `MySQL` for resolving issue in Postgres17, `index bloat, write amplification, replication overhead, data corruption risks, poor MVCC support on replicas, and difficult upgrades`.
- This articles take walkthrough for issue of PostgreSQL, like `index bloat` process via `ctid` and point to the MVCC make the new updated and that create problem, don't have much experience but that's kinda interesting.
- In the end of articles, he try to let us know about how to `mysql` solve the problem of `postgresql` with the strategies in indexes.

[6. Medium - Software Architecture for Developers](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/software-architecture-for-developers-d1d84c108df4)

- If you wanna find the pointer about your position with SA, you should read that one, cuz it give you a couple of properties of SA attached with Developers
- You will find how to growth up your skill about SA via this one, I means it can help you understand what high level compare with your level about thinking arch, that's really good and opportunity for learning
# AI with Kubernetes

[1. Medium - Deploying Ray Cluster for AI/ML workloads on a Kubernetes Cluster](https://rangapv.medium.com/deploying-ray-cluster-for-ai-ml-workloads-on-a-kubernetes-cluster-dfd4ea36e60f)

[2. Medium - Effective Load Balancing with Ray on Amazon SageMaker](https://medium.com/data-science/effective-load-balancing-with-ray-on-amazon-sagemaker-d3b9020679d3)

[3. Alibaba - Best Practices for Ray Clusters - Ray on ACK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/best-practices-for-ray-clusters---ray-on-ack_600925)

- If you approach with AI and Machine Learning in Kubernetes Environment or Local Developer, You will meet the [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) - The framework help you scale and more distribute the AI Solution in multiple platform, and [KubeRay](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay) is the thing created for this responsibility
- These articles show us how we can use and operate best practice for Ray in `Kubernetes`, `SageMaker` and we can deal with them to create the best behavior when you deploy Ray Cluster into environment, and get the good value to manage them. Explore more about Ray at [Documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest)
- Ray is a great techstack but it's really complicated, you need to make sure to understand this native way to get the good approach and behavior.
- More alternative for Ray, such as [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), [Spark and Dask](https://domino.ai/blog/spark-dask-ray-choosing-the-right-framework)
# Data Engineer

[1. Medium - Setting up a Spark standalone cluster on Docker in layman terms](https://medium.com/@MarinAgli1/setting-up-a-spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker-in-layman-terms-8cbdc9fdd14b)

[2. Medium - Setting Up Apache Spark from Scratch in a Docker Container: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://medium.com/@sanjeets1900/setting-up-apache-spark-from-scratch-in-a-docker-container-a-step-by-step-guide-2c009c98f2a7)

[3. Medium - Apache Spark & Airflow in Docker: Step by Step guide](https://blog.devgenius.io/apache-spark-airflow-in-docker-step-by-step-guide-fe02bcdcdedc)

- I just give time to read about `Spark` and here are what things you can need to self-hosted and playground with `Spark`, In docker. If you wanna find how to set up `Spark` in Kubernetes, You should consider to find [Spark Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator) to help you set up `Spark` in your Kubernetes environment
- The things I like most of these blogs because they write about set-up guide with very detail and easier for approaching, you can read and follow with their strategies and source code attached - It's truly useful.
- In the last, I see the cool stories about how can we combine `Spark` and `Airflow`, that's really interesting question. You can double-check about to learn how they structure Spark with Airflow, may be you can use both of them for curial purpose. E.g: You try to run [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) for building your pipeline with remote runner, like `Spark`, `Flink`, or `Google Data Flow`. If you wanna try `Beam` with `Spark`, I think this article [Medium - How to run Apache beam on Spark cluster](https://medium.com/@haoxu_2691/how-to-run-apache-beam-on-spark-cluster-dbb7b20580ce) is good for y'all. NOTE (Remember Java 11 is good start for `Beam` and `Spark`, Trust me)

- In these articles, I just read about how to use `strimzi` - Kafka Operator for Kubernetes - This platform will help us deploy Kafka Cluster with less effort and easier configuration, you can do more things with this operator to create expectation Kafka Cluster for yourself in Kubernetes environment
- Moreover, If you already use `Zookeeper` with Kafka, Strimzi will show us the way to migration from `Zookeeper` to `Kraft`, which directly and manage itself by `Kafka`, It's wonderful than you need to manage `Zookeeper`.
