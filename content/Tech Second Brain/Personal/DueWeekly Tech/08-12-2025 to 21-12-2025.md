# Career / Story

[1. Blog - Xây dựng hạ tầng AWS phức tạp cho business bé - cú sốc về chi phí vận hành](https://blog.cloudmentor.pro/blog/aws-startup/aws-startup-xay-dung-ha-tang-aws-lon-va-khung-hoang-chi-phi)

- This article was a fortunate find while scrolling through my news feed. First and foremost, I want to give a shout-out to **Mr. Nguyen Phong** ([https://www.facebook.com/phonhnx/](https://www.facebook.com/phonhnx/)), the founder of [**CloudExam.pro**](https://cloudexam.pro/), a platform dedicated to AWS Certification training and practice. I am truly impressed and inspired by his spirit in building this platform from the ground up. I hope this message reaches him, and I wish him great success. The article is written in Vietnamese and chronicles his journey and challenges while building the platform from scratch. Although there is currently no commercial alignment, the AWS bill he received—though not substantial—highlights a tough question for any builder or non-profit indie developer: How do you ensure the platform becomes successful, and is the price for this trade-off truly worth it?
- In this blog post, he introduces the **features of his platform**, details how he constructed the **infrastructure on AWS**, and outlines the **next steps** he needs to take. If you are an indie hacker, an open-source developer, or an entrepreneur building a business from scratch in the technology sector, I believe you will both learn from and empathize with the challenges one must face when stepping into this marketplace.

[1. Blog - The 9 Ways to Move Data Kafka -> Iceberg](https://blog.streambased.io/p/the-9-ways-to-move-data-kafka-iceberg)

[2. Blog - Kafka topics to Iceberg Tables](https://www.unskewdata.com/blog/kafka-iceberg)

- Both articles focus on the topic of moving data from **Kafka** into a **Data Lakehouse** environment, specifically leveraging **Iceberg**, which is a leading modern data stack technology today. First, the authors highlight the issues and challenges encountered when migrating data out of Kafka, addressing concerns like **Data Freshness**, **Table Maintenance**, **Partitioning**, and other related complexities. They then explore various methods for dealing with and maintaining Kafka data by copying it to a Lakehouse format like Iceberg.
- Throughout the articles, you will gain further insight into the appropriate **frameworks** and **open-source tools** that can help address this use case. If you work with modern data stacks like Kafka and Iceberg, reading these articles is highly recommended, as they provide useful information and solutions for solving similar problems in your own environment.
# Kubernetes

[1. RedHat - Global Load Balancer Approaches](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/global-load-balancer-approaches) 🌟 **(Recommended)**

- This article presents an overview of **Global Load Balancer (GLB)** solutions when designing a **multi-cluster architecture**, particularly within Kubernetes and OpenShift environments. It explores various methods for approaching GLB, covering **design methodologies** and **automation techniques**, which is highly beneficial for those seeking to learn.
- You will be introduced to two main GLB options: **DNS-Based** and **Anycast-Based**. The DNS-Based method aligns with what I've previously discussed (refer to the article [[The Story of Mine about Multi-Region Architecture]] for more examples and proposals). This approach allows you to adapt any DNS management service (e.g., Route 53, Cloudflare) for domain resolution, though it commonly encounters challenges related to **TTL (Time-To-Live)** and **unbalanced traffic patterns**, which are often observed during DNS-Based GLB configuration.
- The article also discusses the **Anycast-Based** approach, which involves new networking techniques like **IP/BGP** ([https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/)) and **Anycast Cloud Services** (e.g., AWS Global Accelerator (AGA) or Google Cloud Network Load Balancer). The author links this approach to **MetalLB** ([https://metallb.io/](https://metallb.io/)) for BGP routing, providing excellent illustrations for easier comprehension. I believe this blog will furnish you with numerous keywords and methodologies for approaching and researching your GLB implementation.
- Furthermore, for a **Cloud Native** approach within Kubernetes, the article again highlights **k8gb**—the "star" of Kubernetes GLB—along with another implementation developed by Red Hat called **global-load-balancer-operator** ([https://github.com/redhat-cop/global-load-balancer-operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/global-load-balancer-operator)). Both tools are highly effective and compatible with various setups. By delving deeper into these tools, you will gain further expertise in GLB and routing massive traffic between regions for building **Multi-Cluster Kubernetes** implementations.
 
[2. Youtube - Ensuring high availability with global load balancing in Kubernetes - Matthias Hauber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-_zhuwNCAM) 🌟 **(Recommended)**

- This is an excellent video from the **ContainerDays Conference** ([https://www.containerdays.io/](https://www.containerdays.io/)), providing a session and insights on how to tackle problems related to **DNS, CDN, and Global Load Balancing (GLB)** for Kubernetes, especially in a **multi-cluster deployment**. The presenter outlines several potential approaches, such as **Cluster Mesh** (not a true GLB solution) and **CDN**, before focusing on **k8gb** as the current best option for this situation, given its foundation on **CoreDNS** and **ExternalDNS**.
- During the video, you will learn how traffic can be **distributed globally** to the nearest Kubernetes cluster, the challenges encountered in this process, and a **demonstration** that proves the concept works, providing effective **geographic load balancing**. Watching this video will offer valuable insights and knowledge on adapting these concepts and understanding how large-scale Kubernetes clusters manage traffic globally using DNS.

[3. Youtube - Kubernetes Multi Cluster DNS with External DNS, CoreDNS and Etcd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQtv2C4wKEA)

- This is a great video that offers excellent insight into **multi-cluster DNS**, a critical and engaging topic in Kubernetes architecture. You will learn the rationale for building a unified DNS across multiple clusters and identify the key technology stack required for your Kubernetes DNS solution.
- The video comprehensively covers DNS and networking within Kubernetes, spanning **external, internal, and local** resolution, with a focus on **CoreDNS** (the current backbone of Kubernetes DNS). Additionally, it provides a tutorial on setting up **ExternalDNS** to seamlessly route external traffic to internal services, integrated with CoreDNS and Etcd.
- The source code for this implementation is available here: [https://github.com/morrismusumi/kubernetes/tree/main/external-dns](https://github.com/morrismusumi/kubernetes/tree/main/external-dns).
