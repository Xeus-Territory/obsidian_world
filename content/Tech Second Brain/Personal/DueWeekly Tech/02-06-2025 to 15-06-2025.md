[1. Medium - 10 Kafka Design Patterns Every Senior Backend Dev Should Know](https://medium.com/@codingplainenglish/10-kafka-design-patterns-every-senior-backend-dev-should-know-304a9031cf7b)

- This article explores ten popular patterns that users should learn when leveraging Kafka for streaming or event processing, including concepts like Change Data Capture (CDC), Dead Letter Queues (DLQ), Replayable streams, and Fan-Out. This demonstrates why Kafka remains one of the leading streaming platforms in the technology world.
- Throughout the article, you'll discover additional Kafka features and innovative ways others have utilized it for various purposes.
# Kubernetes

[1. Blog - Kubernetes Deployments: ArgoCD and GitHub Actions in Action](https://jackjapar.com/kubernetes-deployments-argocd-and-github-actions-in-action) ðŸŒŸ **(Recommended)**

- This article offers excellent instructions, guiding you from setting up a basic Kubernetes Cluster on AWS EC2 with [K3s](https://k3s.io/) via [K3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup), to successfully building a CI/CD pipeline that combines Argo CD and GitHub Actions for a complete GitOps cycle. While not a new concept, this represents a modern approach in current practices. It's a great starting point for beginners and a useful recap for those looking to replicate the author's cluster setup.
- I was particularly impressed by this article because the author includes code snippets and illustrations. This provides users with more comprehensive information on where and how to execute scripts or perform actions.

[2. Medium - End-to-End Kubernetes Deployment Automation: A Complete Guide for DevOps Teams](https://medium.com/atmosly/end-to-end-kubernetes-deployment-automation-a-complete-guide-for-devops-teams-d8a073418b8e) ðŸŒŸ **(Recommended)**

- True to its title, this article offers a comprehensive guide for constructing an end-to-end Kubernetes infrastructure, leveraging contemporary tools and paradigms. These encompass Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), GitOps (Argo CD), CI/CD (Argo Workflows), security (Trivy), package management (Helm), monitoring (KubeStack-Prometheus), and progressive delivery (Argo Rollouts), among other critical components.
- The article provides a detailed roadmap of the requisite steps and actions for Kubernetes deployment. Adhering to this guide can result in a meticulously configured, production-ready cluster, characterized by simplified maintenance and alignment with global technological innovations, bolstered by extensive community support.

[3. Medium - Modern Kubernetes Ingress the GitOps Way: Envoy Gateway with ArgoCD](https://faun.pub/modern-kubernetes-ingress-the-gitops-way-envoy-gateway-with-argocd-c1bbec4a6a76)

- The author highlights the complexity of operating Ingress controllers in Kubernetes, particularly within large and continuously growing clusters. Recognizing this challenge, the author aims to address this gap by proposing a solution: integrating Argo CD (using an "Apps to Apps" concept) with the Envoy Ingress Controller to serve as a core component of the Kubernetes cluster.
- In the first part of the article, the author introduces [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/) and illustrates how Envoy can be a suitable solution through diagrams. Leveraging Envoy brings powerful features such as Class Gateway definitions, ProxyConfig, and SecurityPolicy.
- Further into the article, the author provides highly detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up Envoy, writing manifest files for its usage, and integrating it into Argo CD Applications. Notably, at the end, the author points out several problems or issues that need consideration when applying their concept, particularly those related to Argo CD, permissions, and configurations.

[4. Medium - Running Stateful Applications with Kubernetes: A Complete Guide](https://medium.com/@salwan.mohamed/running-stateful-applications-with-kubernetes-a-complete-guide-8009d8caeeb7)

- The article serves as an excellent introduction for anyone looking to build and deploy [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) applications in Kubernetes. While it might seem straightforward for beginners, those with long-term experience in Kubernetes will find StatefulSets to be quite complex. Managing them, especially when updates are required, can be particularly challenging as a single workload type.
- For these reasons, I recommend reading this article. It provides valuable insights into best practices, outlining the necessary actions and planning involved in operating StatefulSet workloads in Kubernetes. The author includes two or three practical examples, which are very effective in helping you understand and work with StatefulSet applications.

[5. Medium - 5 Kubernetes Security Vulnerabilities I Found in Every Clientâ€™s Cluster](https://medium.com/@sridharcloud/5-kubernetes-security-vulnerabilities-i-found-in-every-clients-cluster-395320f50f76)

- This article clearly outlines what I assume are the top five mistakes related to indiscreet or deliberate misconfigurations in Kubernetes, particularly concerning security contexts, network exposure, and RBAC permissions. All of these can lead to vulnerabilities in your system. Throughout the article, you'll learn how to protect your cluster in various situations, emphasizing the importance of understanding your actions.
- I believe these mistakes are common in many Kubernetes clusters. While patching them isn't difficult, it's crucial to be aware of them before your cluster becomes a target for attacks.
