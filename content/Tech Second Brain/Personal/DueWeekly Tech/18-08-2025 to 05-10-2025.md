[1. Alibaba - Model Service Mesh: Model Service Management in Cloud-native Scenario](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/model-service-mesh-model-service-management-in-cloud-native-scenario_600863)

- Service mesh isn't just for microservices anymoreâ€”it's also a powerful tool for **optimizing AI workloads**. By using a service mesh, you can significantly streamline the versioning, scaling, and deployment of your machine learning models. While [**Alibaba Cloud Service Mesh (ASM)**](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/servicemesh?spm=a2c65.11461447.0.0.2a1169bd6Q9Gy2) offers a robust, high-performance solution for managing and scheduling model services, you can achieve similar results with the open-source [**KServe**](https://github.com/kserve/kserve).
- This article will provide two complete, hands-on guides. Youâ€™ll learn how to use **KServe** and **PVCs** to deploy your models effectively. This approach supports custom model runtimes like **PyTorch**, **TensorRT**, and **ONNX**. Plus, we'll show you how to use a model mesh to run **Large Language Model (LLM)** inference at scale, giving you the distributed and scalable functionality needed for high-workload scenarios

[2. Blog - Your AI workloads still need a service mesh](https://blog.howardjohn.info/posts/ai-mesh/)

- Whether a **service mesh** is the right choice for an AI workload depends entirely on your specific needs. While it might seem like a solution for everything, a service mesh may not always be the best optionâ€”and sometimes, a different approach is better.
- The author of this article provides strong evidence to explain why blindly adopting a service mesh can be a mistake. Sometimes, a technology is more of a trend than a truly effective solution, and I completely agree with that perspective.
- Before you adopt any new technology for a production environment, you need to think critically about whether it's the right fit. The most successful people in this industry always ask the hard questions, practice with the technology, and honestly evaluate the results.

- Continuing the journey of [KubeFed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed), two projects have emerged to provide multi-cluster orchestration platforms with active and vibrant communities: [**Karmada**](https://karmada.io/) and [**Open Cluster Management (OCM)**](https://open-cluster-management.io/).
- First, a quick shout-out to **KubeFed**. While it has a legacy of its own, its feature incompatibilities, lack of extensibility, and steep learning curve made it a difficult platform to manage, especially when it came to migrations.
- That's where these new tools come in. Both Karmada and OCM were created to address the challenges of KubeFed by providing a core set of features for multi-cluster management. There's real hope for what these two platforms will bring in the future.

[4. Medium - Securing Kubernetes Layer by Layer: An OSI Approach (Part 1: L2 & L3)](https://itnext.io/securing-kubernetes-layer-by-layer-an-osi-approach-part-1-l2-l3-6e78e6c3fbed)

[5. Medium - Securing Kubernetes Layer by Layer: An OSI Approach (Part 2 : L4)](https://itnext.io/securing-kubernetes-layer-by-layer-an-osi-approach-part-2-l4-498c69f951fc)

- These articles are truly impressive. they tackle one of the biggest challenges in any system: **how to ensure security and effective remediation**. You will encounter many issues as you set up and operate a system, and in a world where a cyberattack is always a possibility, your policies must be set up correctly to defend your system.
- To build a strong defense, you need to understand the **OSI Model**. This is especially true when working with Cloud Native platforms like **Kubernetes**, one of today's most popular architectures. This article provides a compelling visual guide to network defense, implementing security at each layer:

	- **L2 (MAC Address):** Using a **CNI**
	- **L3 (IP & Routing):** With **NetworkPolicies**
	- **L4 (TCP/UDP):** Using a **Service Mesh**, **Authorization**, **Namespace Communication**, and **mTLS**
    
- This is an invaluable opportunity for both you and me to learn something new. As a reminder, adding more security is a good thing, but it always comes with trade-offs. You must understand those trade-offs before you push anything to a production environment. It's incredibly difficult to roll back if you don't know what you're doing.
- Don't blindly adopt modern architectures if you don't fully understand them. Instead, learn, research, and roll out slowly to reach your goals while continuously improving your knowledge. This approach will be far more valuable than carrying technical debt forever.
