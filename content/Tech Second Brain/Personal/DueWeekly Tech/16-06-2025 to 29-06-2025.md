[1. Datacamp - Database Sharding: Examples, Strategies, Tools, and More](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/database-sharding) ðŸŒŸ **(Recommended)**

- This article defines **Database Sharding**, explaining when and why it should be implemented. It also helps distinguish between **Sharding and Partitioning**, highlighting their conceptual similarities but distinct meanings. Furthermore, the article elaborates on the differences between Sharding and Replication.
- It then explains how database sharding works, details various sharding strategies, and lists tools that support sharding for MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

[1. Medium - How We Load Test Argo CD at Scale: 1,000 vClusters with GitOps on Kubernetes](https://itnext.io/how-we-load-test-argo-cd-at-scale-1-000-vclusters-with-gitops-on-kubernetes-d8ea2a8935b6) ðŸŒŸ **(Recommended)**

- This article focuses on stress-testing Argo CD with large clusters, experimenting with Kubernetes multi-tenancy via [vClusters](https://www.vcluster.com/). It provides benchmark results and explores how to efficiently scale Argo CD. The author also mentions [Kubara](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4AgmEo3oV8), a templating binary that helps bootstrap a secure, GitOps-enabled Kubernetes control plane, as discussed in the [LF Live Webinar: From CI to Kubernetes Catalog: A Practical Guide to vCluster and GitOps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4AgmEo3oV8) video by The Linux Foundation.
- The article walks through and answers multiple questions, exploring an architecture that manages a large number of applications with Argo CD (+10,000 apps, +250 clusters, etc.). This presents a challenge and is interesting for those exploring scalable environments.
- The article concludes that handling large clusters is hard for Argo CD, and we should consider HPA or splitting Argo CD into smaller components using tools like [Kargo](https://kargo.io/). To explore high availability (HA) provisioning, you can consult [Argo CD HA setup](https://codefresh.io/learn/argo-cd/a-comprehensive-overview-of-argo-cd-architectures-2025/) and the [benchmarking report from CNOE](https://cnoe.io/blog/argo-cd-application-scalability) (Engineers from Intuit and AWS).
