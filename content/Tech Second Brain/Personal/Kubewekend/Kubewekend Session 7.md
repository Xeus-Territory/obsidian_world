Hey there! It's great to reconnect after a while. I hope you've all been doing well and rocking it at work!

My month-long disappearance was due to a mix of thingsâ€”travel, a bit of content block, and, honestly, a touch of laziness. ðŸ˜„ But today feels wonderful because we're diving back into the **Kubewekend series**!

We'll be exploring **Helm, Kubernetes applications**, and even more powerful features with **Cilium**. Get ready to discover how you can structure your **ingress, egress, and network security** for your deployments. Settle in, because we're starting now!

# Kubewekend Before and Now

As I remember about `Kubewekend` in nearest time about we handle extra part about how can we setup `RKE2` for Kubernetes instead `Kind`, you can double-check again in [[Kubewekend Session Extra 2|Kubewekend Session Extra 2: Rebuild Cluster with RKE2 or K3S]]

As I've mentioned in these articles, I chose **RKE2** for our production environment due to considerations like **Container Storage Interface (CSI)** and **High Availability (HA)**, which `kind` doesn't fully address in that context.

However, despite those challenges, I still believe `kind` remains the best option for practicing in a **local Kubernetes environment**. Today, we're revisiting `kind` with **Cilium** to explore how this platform, leveraging **eBPF** and **Network Security CNI**, can enhance our applications.

After a few months, I've dived into several blogs about **Cilium** and its comparison with traditional models like **Kube-Proxy**. These resources explain how **eBPF** is transforming networking in Kubernetes and what trade-offs we make when adopting Cilium. New versions of Cilium are constantly introducing exciting functionalities.

There's a lot happening with **eBPF** and **Cilium** is pushing the boundaries. You can find more great information by reading the articles or visiting the LinkedIn and blog posts linked below.

As you can see, I never believe mine about missing many news of this technologies, I grow fast and crazy couple recently months with AI Blooming, that's insane. BTW, I will try to recap and learn again by taking walkthrough with a really tugh

- Feature of Cilium Deployment, CLI Is great,  but we can explore more configuration in Cilium with Operator, CRDs via [Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium)
- Define a Helm template for application using features of Cilium like `network-policy`, `ingress` or `gateway` ðŸ‘‰ [Kubewekend Helm Chart](https://kubewekend.xeusnguyen.xyz/#helm-chart)
