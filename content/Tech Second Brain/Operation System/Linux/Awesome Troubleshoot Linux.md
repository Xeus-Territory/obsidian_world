# Error when package code needs to be installed, but I can't find an archive for it

Link for resolve: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/s6l82d/trying_to_up_date_the_system_but_keep_getting/)

If you package problem, for example (`Code`). You need to perform these command

```bash
# Location the error or missing package
sudo apt policy code

# Reinstall or purge your package cause error
sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq code
sudo apt purge code --autoremove
sudo apt install --fix-broken
sudo apt update
```

# `libssl` error in Ubuntu 22.04

>[!info]
>Ubuntu 22.04 has upgraded libssl to 3 and does not propose libssl1.1, so when you install packages that meet the problems, with me when setup `Azure agent`, read at [[Awesome Azure Pipelines#The SSL connection could not be established, and No usable version of libssl was found|The SSL connection could not be established, and No usable version of libssl was found]]. But when you need to revert some other version problem will mess up, you can follow this one and reboot your machine to applied compatible version of `libssl`

Link issue: [StackOverFlow - MongoDB Install Fails on Ubuntu 22.04 - Depends on libssl1.1 but it is not installable](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1403619/mongodb-install-fails-on-ubuntu-22-04-depends-on-libssl1-1-but-it-is-not-insta)

Package: [libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb](https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/20.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb.html)

1. Install via source-list when you import the key

```shell
# Write a source of package into apt, to retrieve the version of package
echo "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/focal-security.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl1.1

# Delete the focal-security list file you just created
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/focal-security.list
```

2. Manually installed

```shell
# Retrive the package from ubuntu repositories
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb

# Install the lib debian file which you download
sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
```

# Problem with `ssh`

When you see the situation about your key for authentication a destination host have changing because your action or hacker, from your side you can resolve when exection `ssh` by flushing the old key like

```bash
ssh-keygen -f "/home/user/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "[127.0.0.1]:6996"
```

>[!done]
>It will help you update your known_hosts, and give you permission to authentication remote host with new cred

If you meet situation about, `cannot auth ssh via password`. It means, usually your host will protect your `VM` with no enable `PasswordAuthentication` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_conf`. If you want to enable, you need to perform

```bash
# Change content sshd_config
sudo sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Restart ssh vervice
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# OR
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh force-reload
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
```

# Could not load 'vboxdrv' after upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 (and I want to keep secure boot)

>[!info]
>That issue come from when you install the `virtualbox` in OS with enable secure boot in the `BIOS`, usually come from individual machine, I thinks. Mostly you install `virtualbox` from `apt`, it will not applied when your machine meet that problem. Can explain more 😅

You can find the solution for secure boot at

- [I can't execute command modprobe vboxdrv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38437264/i-cant-execute-command-modprobe-vboxdrv)
- [Could not load 'vboxdrv' after upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 (and I want to keep secure boot)](https://askubuntu.com/questions/760671/could-not-load-vboxdrv-after-upgrade-to-ubuntu-16-04-and-i-want-to-keep-secur)

>[!quote]
>That is tough think for new start, I know but you have 2 way to resolve the problem, i dunno make sure you follow what but, this is the same between them but one side is manually generate and other use `deb` with include that step. Follow if you solve the problem

**First method**

>[!note]
>Manually generate, and submit `mok` for authentication secure boot, that new for me and cost me time to understand 😄 but that gradually valuable

```bash
# Install the mkutil package to be able to do signed
# Often, your host will include this tool, if not download it
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mokutil -y

# Generate the signature file
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.priv -outform DER -out MOK.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=VirtualBox/"

# Add it to the kernal
sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der $(modinfo -n vboxdrv)

# Register it for the Secure Boot
# In this step, it will ask you provide the password
# provide it what you want, remember and retype when reboot MOK again
sudo mokutil --import MOK.der

# Do the reboot machine now, with reboot or shutdown command
sudo shutdown -r now # sudo reboot (same actions)
```

![[Pasted image 20240706163413.png]]

When reboot you will see the screen, choose `Enroll MOK` to continue. Answer the step in blue screen `Enroll MOK > Continue > Yes > and it will ask you for the password > reboot`. That will boot you to `ubuntu`. After that to validate it work or not, you can do

```bash
# Check version and problems of virtualbox, if not
# Use are completely resolving the problem
VBoxManage --version

# (Optional) To check MOK key, sign and status, use
sudo mokutil --list-enrolled
```

If not work at all, you need to delete the `MOK key` and will do the another optional

```bash
# Delete the key (On the situation, you continue keep key)\
# basically, you just need delete with key selected
sudo mokutil --delete /your/key/enrolled

# Check the key will add to queue to delete
sudo mokutil --list-delete # exist, it will be okay

# Reboot, and do enroll MOK boot like above
sudo reboot
```

Your work will have different, you can follow `Enroll MOK > Delete > Yes > and it will ask you for the password > reboot` . That all you remove the old key, if you delete or forgot where you put the key, follow this step

```bash
# You will export the key you enrolled
mokutil --export

# Usually, that will have name with syntax, e.g: MOK-xxxx.der
# take a look list-enrolled, map that with the key, for example
# If your key which want delete on location, you will choose
# MOK-0002.der with same command above
sudo mokutil --delete MOK-0002.der
```

**Second method**

>[!note]
>That will simple, but make sure you do same thing above but the `virtualbox` will give you all step and just need prompt your password, remember for re-typing again in MOK

This method will require you install `virtualbox` from official documentation, you can use `wget` , `curl` or you can directly click and install that, [here the link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

After that, you need install that with `--fix-broken` to help you install dependencies packages with your `deb`

```bash
# For example, I use Ubuntu 24.04. It can be done like this
# You will ask to prompt password in the last step
sudo apt --fix-broken install ./virtualbox-7.0_7.0.18-162988~Ubuntu~noble_amd64.deb -y

# Reboot and do MOK step like above
sudo shutdown -r now
```

>[!done]
>That will help you resolve this case, maybe when you have new version of Ubuntu that can be reason why you had the problems, make sure you control that

# Swap mode in Ubuntu

>[!info]
>You can swap mode in Ubuntu from desktop mode to server mode, by use key combining

- **Ctrl + Alt + F1** : To use desktop mode
- **Ctrl + Alt + F3**: To use shell or server mode

# Clean Swap memory

With architecture of linux, swap memory submit crucial role for operating stuff inside machine, bring back stability and performance. Explore about swap memory at [Phoenix - Swap Space in Linux: What It Is & How It Works](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/swap-space)

>[!warning]
>The customization into swap memory need to concern before do because you will touch into part with one making decision for performance main system

But you can gently clean that with few commands to help you collect, and get swap memory back to machine. E.g: When you compile java, if you not configure `jvm` with good behavior, It will use a lot memory and swap is one of those.

To prevent that, you can use command below to disable all swap partition, it will help reclaim memory swap being use

```bash
sudo swapoff -a
```

After reclaim, you can turn on it again for reusing to continuous provide swap memory for system

```bash
sudo swapon -a
```

You can explore and figure out more configuration and memory with linux through article

- [Tecmint - How to Clear RAM Memory Cache, Buffer and Swap Space on Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/clear-ram-memory-cache-buffer-and-swap-space-on-linux/)

# Set and use environment variables from `.env` file

>[!info]
>Read more about topic at
>-  [StackOverFlow - Set environment variables from file of key/value pairs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331497/set-environment-variables-from-file-of-key-value-pairs)
>- [FreeCodeCamp - How to Set an Environment Variable in Linux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-an-environment-variable-in-linux/)

Use export with except `#` line in `.env` file

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

When you want to work with script, you can use `-o allexport`

```bash
# Multiple line
set -o allexport
source dot/env/file
set +o allexport

# One line
set -o allexport && source dot/env/file && set +o allexport
```

In some case, you wanna disable a environment in current shell, so you can

```bash
unset ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
```
# Update Ubuntu new version

You can use integration tool inside `ubuntu` to update new version, that will pull and update packages inside host, do that easily with command

```bash
# Check the linux version
lsb_release -a

# Use command to update new version ubuntu
do-release-upgrade
```

>[!warning]
>In this situation you update `ubuntu`, it will update your kernel so please remember make a big-changes can gain different harden to control, so do know before you doing

Follow some methodology to upgrade new version of kernel, such as

- [How to Update Linux Kernel In Ubuntu](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-update-kernel-ubuntu)
- [Cập nhật Linux Kernel trên Ubuntu 20.04](https://thuanbui.me/cap-nhat-linux-kernel-tren-ubuntu-20-04/) (Vietnamese)
- [How to Update/Upgrade Linux Kernel in Ubuntu](https://www.dedicatedcore.com/blog/update-linux-kernel-ubuntu/)
- [Ubuntu Linux Upgrade Linux Kernel Command](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-upgrading-the-ubuntu-linux-kernel/)

Depend on those articles, you can update `kernel` of Ubuntu via

- Update OS version (e.g. 20.04 --> 22.04)
- Update package of OS dependencies
- Manually Update

When you choose manually update, you can use some following tools

- [Mainline](https://github.com/bkw777/mainline)
- [ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh](https://github.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh)
- Directly download use `curl` or `wget` and installing from [pkgs.org](https://pkgs.org/)

If you see this one from via `kubewekend` series, I prefer to use update Ubuntu version or use secondly optional via `apt` like

```bash
# check your kernel version, via uname
uname -r

# find the supportive from apt repositories, via apt search
sudo apt search linux-image

# figure out the compatible version, if you come from kubewekend you can use version 5.15.0-116-generic, so we install via
sudo apt install linux-virtual-hwe-20.04 -y

# Reboot to receive the new update
sudo reboot # OR use sudo shutdown -r now
```

# Update alternative version

>[!quote]
>When you have multiple version of tools, package or moreover, like `python` `java jdk` `shell`, you need to switch between of them  that why you need the topic

For change and update the configuration between different of tools, `debian` core offer us the command call `update-alternatives`. Let digest to its

You can find the manual of the command with `--help` flag

```bash
$ update-alternatives --help
Usage: update-alternatives [<option> ...] <command>

Commands:
  --install <link> <name> <path> <priority>
    [--slave <link> <name> <path>] ...
                           add a group of alternatives to the system.
  --remove <name> <path>   remove <path> from the <name> group alternative.
  --remove-all <name>      remove <name> group from the alternatives system.
  --auto <name>            switch the master link <name> to automatic mode.
  --display <name>         display information about the <name> group.
  --query <name>           machine parseable version of --display <name>.
  --list <name>            display all targets of the <name> group.
  --get-selections         list master alternative names and their status.
  --set-selections         read alternative status from standard input.
  --config <name>          show alternatives for the <name> group and ask the
                           user to select which one to use.
  --set <name> <path>      set <path> as alternative for <name>.
  --all                    call --config on all alternatives.

<link> is the symlink pointing to /etc/alternatives/<name>.
  (e.g. /usr/bin/pager)
<name> is the master name for this link group.
  (e.g. pager)
<path> is the location of one of the alternative target files.
  (e.g. /usr/bin/less)
<priority> is an integer; options with higher numbers have higher priority in
  automatic mode.

Options:
  --altdir <directory>     change the alternatives directory
                             (default is /etc/alternatives).
  --admindir <directory>   change the administrative directory
                             (default is /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives).
  --instdir <directory>    change the installation directory.
  --root <directory>       change the filesystem root directory.
  --log <file>             change the log file.
  --force                  allow replacing files with alternative links.
  --skip-auto              skip prompt for alternatives correctly configured
                           in automatic mode (relevant for --config only)
  --quiet                  quiet operation, minimal output.
  --verbose                verbose operation, more output.
  --debug                  debug output, way more output.
  --help                   show this help message.
  --version                show the version.
```

When you want to take a look how the version we have, such as `java` you can call with `--list` flag and name, example

```bash
$ update-alternatives --list java
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java
/usr/lib/jvm/java-18-openjdk-amd64/bin/java
```

And  when you have decision, on my situation `java` on my machine on `11` but I want to switch to `18`, you can perform this command

```bash
# Check version java
$ java --version
openjdk 11.0.22 2024-01-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.22+7-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu222.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.22+7-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu222.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)

# Change version to 18
$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                         Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-18-openjdk-amd64/bin/java   1811      auto mode
* 1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java   1111      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-18-openjdk-amd64/bin/java   1811      manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 0
update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/jvm/java-18-openjdk-amd64/bin/java to provide /usr/bin/java (java) in auto mode

# Check the version java again
$ java --version
openjdk 18.0.2-ea 2022-07-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 18.0.2-ea+9-Ubuntu-222.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.2-ea+9-Ubuntu-222.04, mixed mode, sharing)

# Redirect Output and Error

>[!note]
>Reference ▶️ ▶️ ▶️  [How to Redirect Output and Error to /dev/null in Linux](https://linuxhandbook.com/redirect-dev-null/)
## Some thing about the output of linux

- In the linux machine,  `/dev/null` that will location where you can return null for your shell like `command 2>&1 /dev/null`
- There will have 3 three type of output which linux has
	- Standard input (stdin) is designated with 0
	- Standard output (stdout) is designated with 1
	- Standard error (stderr) is designated with 2
## Redirect output to /dev/null in Linux
   
*For example*: You run `apt install curl` but you want your shell not return anything you can redirect `output` into `/dev/null`. It will be like 

```bash
sudo apt install curl 1>/dev/null
```

![[Drawing 2024-02-18 14.22.10.excalidraw.png]]

*Usage: Used it when you don't want `stdout` go to your shell, just removing the odd things and keep the important output*
## Redirect error to /dev/null in Linux
   
*For example*: You run `find /` but you run with non root, so somecase you will have some permission error output to your shell. You can use `/dev/null` for removing this messing stuff

```bash
find / 2> /dev/null
```

![[Pasted image 20240218143855.png]]

## Combine `stdout` and `stderror` into one with this character `&`
   
```bash
1. Long version
find / 2> /dev/null 1>/dev/null

2. Short version
find / 2>&1 /dev/null (Send error to output and send them to /dev/null)

3. Some other case
find / > /dev/null 2>&1
```

>[!attention] Sometime you can use version `2` of combining
>	
>The `2>&1` part means "redirect the error stream into the output stream", so when you redirect the output stream, error stream gets redirected as well. Even if your program writes to `stderr` now, that output would be discarded as well. ([Sergey Kalinichenko](https://stackoverflow.com/users/335858/sergey-kalinichenko))

# User Management in Linux

>[!info]
>With User and Group configuration in Linux become potential to managing, and enhance your security, user connection and moreover. Following some situation to keep some command that be useful for us when manipulate this stuff inside Linux

Some articles can be good for us when practicing with those stuff around

- [Ubuntu Doc - User management](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/user-management)
- [User Management in Linux](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/user-management-linux)
- [How to Manage Users in Linux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-manage-users-in-linux/)
- [Introduction to usermod command](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/usermod-command-in-linux/)
## Change Password

If you want to change password of current user, you can use command

```bash
# For Current User
passwd

# For Root User
sudo passwd

# For another user
passwd <username>
```

## Add and Delete user

In this situation, you have multiple command to handle it, such as `adduser`, `useradd`, `deluser` and `userdel`. With the graduation introduce by Ubuntu Doc, I will choose `adduser` and `deluser` to handle this case

```bash
# Add user with no need handle much
sudo adduser username

# Del user with no need erase through multiple steps
sudo deluser username
```

## Add and Delete user out of group

There is many way to handle this work, but I prefer to use it with `usermod` command

```bash
# Add user to group
sudo usermod -aG group username

# Remove user out group
sudo usermod -rG group username
```

## Helpful `usermod` command

Change your user with new name, but you need do it on another user with kill that shell, because if you access to your old account, I will be attached by process

```bash
sudo usermod -l old_name new_name
```

Change the shell of user, you can switch to user to use `chsh` but this can be done remotely

```bash
sudo usermod --shell /path/to/shell username
```

Move the content of user's home directory using `usermod` command

```bash
sudo usermod -d new_dir_path -m user_name
```

# Run Background Command

>[!info]
>In some situation, when you want to multitasking on your shell but the task become sophisticated and should run in longtime for initiating or deleting somethings, you should move that into background and run to complete, you can use couple of tools and utilities of Linux to handle this, such as `Ampersand (&)`, `screen`, `tmux`, ...

You can double-check some articles to gather more information

- [Phoenixnap - How to Run Linux Commands in Background](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-run-command-background)
- [GitHub - tmux shortcuts & cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058)
- [GitHub - how-to-tmux-background-process.md](https://gist.github.com/davydany/d33f4b5e19eab6b805b045b91d3cf858)
- [How to Use Linux's screen Command](https://www.howtogeek.com/662422/how-to-use-linuxs-screen-command/)

## Use Ampersand (&)

This is one of utilities already integrating inside your linux, you just playground with `&` with your command

```bash
# Run command in background
[command] &

# e.g
ping -4 google.com &
```

This will move this command into background and run to successful, you can check that via `jobs` command

```bash
# List all jobs background in your host
jobs
```

You can use `fg` for turn back command from background to current your shell

```bash
# Back with command
fg %<command> # e.g fg %nano

# Back with PID
fg <pid>
```

If you wanna suspend command, you can just hotkey `ctrl + z` to move process running into background and if you wanna run again in background, you can use `bg` command

## Use `screen`

This one is one kind of popular method, you can use `screen` command to help you move the command into screen and you can control and manipulate multitask in multiple screen.

To install `screen`, you can use

```bash
sudo apt install screen -y
```

Now use `screen` to move your shell into `screen` mode

```bash
screen
```

Now, you can operate that one, try run long command such as `ping` and run hotkey `ctrl+a d` to attach this session

List all screen, you can use

```bash
screen -ls
```

To turn screen again, you can use with id of screen output from `ls` option or use name of shell

```bash
# Return by id
screen -r 2429028

# If you set your screen name like, e.g screen -S curl-command
# Return by name
screen -r curl-command
```

## Use `tmux`

If I have talk about background process, most of my friend will relate `tmux` and I know many `linux` user use `tmux` every single day, so why not learn a bit about that one

For `tmux` installation, you can use

```bash
sudo apt install tmux -y
```

Now run `tmux` command for executing new session

```bash
tmux
```

You are in `tmux`, so try to run `ping` or `curl` command in longtime and you can use hotkey `ctrl+b d` for detaching your session into background

Now if you wanna turn your `tmux` again, you can use `tmux` with attach option

```bash
tmux a # or tmux attach
```

For more specific, you can add name for new session and turn it back with the name for more distinguish between multitasking

```bash
# specific name
tmux new -s tmux-first

# turn it back with name
tmux attach -t tmux-first
```

For list `tmux`  session, you can use

```bash
tmux ls
```

Some cool functionality of `tmux` with hotkey, including

- **Create a new tab:** `[CTRL]+[b], [c]`
- **Switch to tab number:** `[CTRL]+[b], <number>`
- **Enable Scrolling up / Page up:** `[CTRL]+[b], [`
- **Vertical Split**: `[CTRL]+[b], %`
- **Horizontal Split**: `[CTRL]+[b], "`
- **Kill tab**: `[CTRL]+[b], x`
