# Introduce Azure Pipelines

>[!Summary]
>The Gallery of Azure DevOps pipelines, where I share experience about some approaching automation in this platform.

# Deploy React application to  Azure SWA

>Pipelines will help you deploy and release react application to `swa` of Azure Cloud

First of all, you need to provide this `json` file for purpose set up `swa-cli` what use to provide configuration and deploy your application

```json title="swa-cli.config.json"
{
    "$schema": "https://aka.ms/azure/static-web-apps-cli/schema",
    "configurations": {
      "wiki": {

        "run": "npm run start",
        "appDevserverUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
        "env": "production"
      }
    }
}
```

        displayName: Deploy the web page
        steps:
          - task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@0
            inputs:

          - script: |
              npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli
              swa --version
              swa deploy --deployment-token=$(token_release)
            workingDirectory: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src
            displayName: Install swa and deploy application
          
```

Just create a pipeline on `Azure DevOps` and trigger the pipeline by manually, and provide some require environment variables for pipeline, like `token_release` (Token of Azure SWA) and `PoolName` (Name of agent to perform pipeline)

Click `Run` to trigger pipeline, last state will announce your deployment completely with your web application domain

>[!note]
>Policy on auto trigger, just work with `main` branch. So if you work with another branch, like `production`,`develop`, ... Thus we need, change `trigger` value to your specify branch. Issue: [StackOverFlow - Using CI triggers and PR build validation together: Prevent that build runs twice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61737516/using-ci-triggers-and-pr-build-validation-together-prevent-that-build-runs-twic)

```yaml {5-8,10-13}
# Just work with main, if you push the pr
trigger: none

# If you want to use both pr and trigger (For another branch)
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - develop

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - develop
```
## Optional

To help PR event occur trigger CI automation, you need to configure  `Policy` for branch, for example

![[Pasted image 20240524160443.png]]

You want trigger for `main` branch, so you need choose `Branch polices` option, It will bring you to another page for setup `policy`

![[Pasted image 20240524160939.png]]

On the `Build Validation`, you can choose `+` button for adding build validation with trigger automation your pipeline

![[Pasted image 20240524161037.png|center]]

For example, I have `react-native` pipeline, It will automation trigger this one when I create PR. 
- You can choose **Manual** for instead but if you want, 
- Others optional, you can clarify **Required** or **Optional** to accept build `failed` pipeline, that cause block
- Choose the Build expiration to set time line of Build events to validate

![[Pasted image 20240524161635.png]]

When trigger, your pipeline will set `PR automated for` instead of `Individual CI`

## Troubleshoot

>[!warning]
>When you use `succeeded()` expression, remember import name branch you need to check on on the single quote bracket like `succeeded('build')`, it mean this task will read-only the status state of `build` stage, if not it will read all values of **stage** or **job** in pipeline, and make a decision

>2. [DownloadPipelineArtifact@2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/download-pipeline-artifact-v2?view=azure-pipelines)

You can use `publish` plugin to upload your file into artifact of Azure Pipeline

```yaml title="artifact-hub/azure-pipelines.yml"
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
 
stages:
  - stage: build_publish_artifacts
    displayName: Build and publish
    jobs:
      - job: publish_artifacts
        displayName: publish artifacts
        steps:
	      # Write text into the file
          - script: |
              echo "artifact-123" > artifact.txt
            displayName: Publish artifact

            inputs:
              ArtifactName: public
              PathtoPublish: "artifact.txt"
```

After that in other repository inside project, you can easily retrieve that artifact from your pipeline

  - stage: download_publish_artifacts

# Error and Troubleshoot

## The SSL connection could not be established, and No usable version of libssl was found

With the sentence `No usable version of libssl was found`, usually meet on Ubuntu 22.04, you can fix by install `openssl`

Ubuntu: [Ubuntu Package](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/)
Issue: [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/issues/3599)

```bash
wget -c http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.0g-2ubuntu4_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.0g-2ubuntu4_amd64.deb
```

After that, you can run `./config.sh`, but next sentence will problems `The SSL connection could not be established`. You can resolve that one with `ENV AZP` variables

First export to environment variable `AZP_AGENT_USE_LEGACY_HTTP` and run `./config.sh`

```bash
export AZP_AGENT_USE_LEGACY_HTTP=true

./config.sh
```

After that, you need set to environment to agent to bypass the SSL issue in `runsvc.sh` file

```bash title="runsvc.sh"
#!/bin/bash

# convert SIGTERM signal to SIGINT
# for more info on how to propagate SIGTERM to a child process see: http://veithen.github.io/2014/11/16/sigterm-propagation.html
trap 'kill -INT $PID' TERM INT

if [ -f ".path" ]; then
    # configure
    export PATH=`cat .path`
    echo ".path=${PATH}"
fi

# insert anything to setup env when running as a service
export AZP_AGENT_USE_LEGACY_HTTP=true

# run the host process which keep the listener alive
./externals/node10/bin/node ./bin/AgentService.js &
PID=$!
wait $PID
trap - TERM INT
wait $PID
```

And that all, trigger `svc.sh` file to setup and connect the agent to pool

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```
