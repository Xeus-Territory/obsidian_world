# Build Mobile with Expo

You need to use `eas.json` to configuration how can `expo-cli` talk with your source code

```json title="eas.json"
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 10.2.1"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "previewAndroid": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk",
        "env": {
          "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL" : "https://xeusnguyen.xyz/"
        }
      }
    },
    "bundle": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle",
        "gradleCommand": "app:bundleRelease",
        "env": {
          "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL" : "https://xeusnguyen.xyz/"
        }
      }
    },
    "previewApple": {
      "ios": {
        "env": {
          "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL": "https://xeusnguyen.xyz/"
        }
      }
    },
    "production": {}
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}

```

After define that you will have permission to use `expo` inside your github-actions
