>Hi everyone! It's been a while since I've been in the game, you know, the thing I've always loved doing. I recently spent some time researching and setting up a high-availability (HA) database for my own workspace, and I'm ready to share that entire journey with you. This is going to be a long series, therefore getting comfortable and let's dive into what we've got today. I hope you enjoy it!

# Why are we should operate HA Database for production-ready ?

If youâ€™ve reached this post, you likely have one of three reasons for wanting to understand high-availability (HA) database operations:

1. Youâ€™re simply curious about the journey Iâ€™m about to share.
2. Youâ€™re struggling to provision an HA database on your own. When I say 'on your own,' I mean from scratch on a raw machine, not in the cloud. This is one of the hardest configurations to get right, and we'll cover every detail to ensure you know what you're doing.
3. Or, you stumbled upon this post and are simply interested in learning something new. I'll share specific knowledge on topics like configuration, challenges, key takeaways, and the coolest parts of the process.

>Why are you should operate HA for Database ?

It's toughly question ever, you will encounter lot of troubles if your application downtime and it shouldn't be occur. Downtime most often occurs during critical processes or connections, and database queries and connections are among the most crucial parts of any system.

If you have time, I encourage you to follow these articles to learn about failover and high availability (HA) in system architectureâ€”a truly important topic that should be a high priority for every developer.

# High Availability: Is It Really Necessary?

Before you dive into High Availability (HA) for your system, it's crucial to first clarify what your application is for, read more in this article: [Dev.to - Stop Building for "Scale." You Don't Have Users Yet](https://dev.to/shayy/stop-building-for-scale-you-dont-have-users-yet-4aep)

- **Proof of Concept (POC) or Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** For these projects, HA is completely unnecessary. You'll only waste time and money on something that doesn't directly contribute to your core product's success.
- **A Simple System:** A major mistake is adding unnecessary complexity. If your database isn't slow and you're not experiencing traffic spikes, provisioning an HA database doesn't make any sense.
- **Production-Ready with High Workload:** This is the key signal. If your application is in a production environment and consistently handles a high workload, you absolutely need to start considering an HA system and failover at every stage of your program's lifecycle.

By asking these questions, you can avoid common pitfalls and make the right decision for your system.

# What is High Availability generally mean?

Following the articles [Percona - High Availability in PostgreSQL with Patroni](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/17/solutions/high-availability.html), you can imagine the HA Database in specific and HA System Architecture means

>[!info]
>*"**The ability to operate continuously without disruption during an outage.** This is achieved by using **automatic failover** - a technique that seamlessly switches from a failed system to a healthy system with minimal disruption, and all without any human intervention. In short, the system automates the entire recovery process"*

Adopting High Availability is a significant step, but your knowledge must evolve as your system becomes more complex. As you integrate new components, you're also adding more technical debt to your management. There's no denying the value these systems bring, but that value always comes at a price.

By choosing to set up your own on-premises system, you've already proven your courage. So, always stay updated and be direct in your approach. Ensure you have the right tools for debugging, backup, and rollback when you need them.

# The options for operating High Availability DB

Before you dive deeper into setting up a High Availability (HA) architecture for these databases, you can review the checklist below. It contains my personal recommendations and suggestions to help you start your journey with HA.
