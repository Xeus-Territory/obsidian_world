# Resource reservations

![[k8s-resource-reservation.png]]

Documentation: [ðŸ”—Click to the link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#resource-reservations)

>[!info]
>AKS uses node resources to help the node function as part of your cluster. This usage can create a discrepancy between your node's total resources and the allocatable resources in AKS. Remember this information when setting requests and limits for user deployed pods.

You can use command for check the node resource allocated

```bash
kubectl describe node [NODE_NAME]

# Example:
Capacity:
  cpu:                2
  ephemeral-storage:  50620216Ki
  hugepages-1Gi:      0
  hugepages-2Mi:      0
  memory:             8129880Ki
  pods:               110
Allocatable:
  cpu:                1900m
  ephemeral-storage:  46651590989
  hugepages-1Gi:      0
  hugepages-2Mi:      0
  memory:             5474648Ki
  pods:               110

```

Two types of resources are reserved:

## CPU

>[!info]
>Reserved CPU is dependent on node type and cluster configuration, which may cause less allocatable CPU due to running additional features.

|CPU cores on host|1|2|4|8|16|32|64|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Kube-reserved (millicores)|60|100|140|180|260|420|740|
Example:

- If your node has 2 CPU core, the reservation will take `100m` and your real quotas is `2000m - 100m = 1900m`
- If your node has 4 CPU core, the reservation will take `140m` and your real quotas is `4000m - 140m = 3860m`

## Memory

With version `1.27.7` - stable K8s version with applied old utilized by AKS includes the sum of two values., but when you use from `1.29` or later, `kubelet` is have big change in concept, read more at: [Memory reservations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/node-resource-reservations#memory-reservations)

1. **`kubelet`Â daemon**Â is installed on all Kubernetes agent nodes to manage container creation and termination. By default on AKS,Â `kubelet`Â daemon has theÂ _memory.available<750Mi_Â eviction rule, ensuring a node must always have at least 750Mi allocatable at all times. When a host is below that available memory threshold, theÂ `kubelet`Â will trigger to terminate one of the running pods and free up memory on the host machine.

2. **A regressive rate of memory reservations**Â for the kubelet daemon to properly function (_kube-reserved_).
    
    - 25% of the first 4GB of memory
    - 20% of the next 4GB of memory (up to 8GB)
    - 10% of the next 8GB of memory (up to 16GB)
    - 6% of the next 112GB of memory (up to 128GB)
    - 2% of any memory above 128GB

>[!info]
>Memory and CPU allocation rules are designed to do the following:
>
>- Keep agent nodes healthy, including some hosting system pods critical to cluster health.
>
>- Cause the node to report less allocatable memory and CPU than it would report if it weren't part of a Kubernetes cluster.
>
>**Memory resource reservations can't be changed.**

Example:

*If your node has 8GB Memory, your actually memory quotas reporting is*

```text
Threadhold eviction (Not change): 750Mi (0.75)
For first 4GB: 25% (0.25 * 4 = 1 = 1000Mi)
For next 4GB: 20% (0.20 * 4 = 0.8 = 800Mi)

Real Memory Quotas

8Gi - (750 + 1000 + 800) = 8000Mi - 2550Mi = 5450Mi
```

## Conclusion

- CPU hasn't eviction range but it has limitation,  `Insufficient CPU` can occur if it over `1900m` for sum of request
- Memory has eviction range `(750Mi)`, If you work with customize cluster, you can change the value but Azure can't. Make sure your resource **always down** and not over others `750Mi` for stabling and preventing, `eviction` and `termination` by `Kubelet`
- Memory also has allocated range, if sum of request your resource over allocated value like over `5450Mi`, `Insufficient Memory` can occur

# Node pools & Node selectors

*Documentation: [Node pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#node-pools) - [Node selectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#node-selectors)* 

![[azure-aks-structure.png]]

>[!info]
><h2>What is Node Pools ?</h2>
>
>Nodes of the same configuration are grouped together intoÂ *node pools*. A Kubernetes cluster contains at least one node pool. The initial number of nodes and size are defined when you create an AKS cluster, which creates aÂ *default node* pool. This default node pool in AKS contains the underlying VMs that run your agent nodes.
>
>You scale or upgrade an AKS cluster against the default node pool. You can choose to scale or upgrade a specific node pool. For upgrade operations, running containers are scheduled on other nodes in the node pool until all the nodes are successfully upgraded.

In an AKS cluster with multiple node pools, you may need to tell the Kubernetes Scheduler which node pool to use for a given resource. This is suitable situation for choosing `nodeSelector`

The following basic example schedules an NGINX instance on a Linux node using the node selectorÂ *pool: infrapool*:

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.12-alpine
  nodeSelector:
    pool: infrapool
```

# Workload and Schedule

## Pods

Documentation: [ðŸ”—Click to the link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#pods)

>[!info]
>Kubernetes uses pods to **run** an instance of **your application**. A pod **represents** a **single instance** of your **application**.

![[k8s-general.png]]

You can use command to get the pod (application pod)

```bash
# -n : namespace (= default)

kubectl get -n default pods <your-pod>
```

If you want to detecting what container is used in `Pod`, find it with `deployments` via command

```bash
# -o wide: output with more information (image container)

kubectl get -n default deployments <your-deployment> -o wide
```

>[!note]
>**NOTICE:** *But Pod can contain multiple containers, scheduled together on the same node, and allow containers to share related resources.*

>[!todo]
>Best practice is to include resource limits for all pods to help the Kubernetes Scheduler identify necessary, permitted resources.

>[!summary]
>A pod is a logical resource, but application workloads run on the containers. Pods are typically ephemeral, disposable resources. Individually scheduled pods miss some of the high availability and redundancy Kubernetes features. Instead, pods are deployed and managed by Kubernetes Controllers, such as the Deployment Controller.

## Deployments and YAML manifests

![[k8s-deployment-workload.png]]

Documentation: [ðŸ”—Click to the link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#deployments-and-yaml-manifests)

>[!info]
>A deployment represents identical pods managed by the Kubernetes Deployment Controller. A deployment defines the number of pod replicas to create. The Kubernetes Scheduler ensures that additional pods are scheduled on healthy nodes if pods or nodes encounter problems.

You can update deployments to change the configuration of pods, container image used, or attached storage. The Deployment Controller:

- Drains and terminates a given number of replicas.
- Creates replicas from the new deployment definition.
- Continues the process until all replicas in the deployment are updated.

You can image `yaml` manifest of `deployment` when apply `helm` like 

```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.2-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 64Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 256Mi
```

## StatefulSets and DaemonSets

Documentation: [ðŸ”—Click to the link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#statefulsets-and-daemonsets)

>[!info]
>Using the Kubernetes Scheduler, the Deployment Controller runs replicas on any available node with available resources. While this approach may be sufficient for stateless applications, the Deployment Controller isn't ideal for applications that require:
>- A persistent naming convention or storage.
>- A replica to exist on each select node within a cluster.
>
>Two Kubernetes resources, however, let you manage these types of applications:
>
>- StatefulSets maintain the state of applications beyond an individual pod lifecycle.
>- DaemonSets ensure a running instance on each node, early in the Kubernetes bootstrap process.

### StatefulSets

Documentation: [ðŸ”—Click to the link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#statefulsets)

![[k8s-service-pods-volumes.png]]

>[!info]
>With StatefulSet, you can consider when create
>
>- **Database components**
>- **Application** work with **high-performance** and **not removing data from server**
>
>Define the application in YAML format using `kind: StatefulSet`.
>
>The StatefulSet Controller handles the deployment and management of the required replicas. Data is written to persistent storage, provided by Azure Managed Disks or Azure Files.
> 
>With StatefulSets, the underlying persistent storage remains, even when the StatefulSet is deleted.
### DaemonSets

![[k8s-daemonset-workload.png]]

*Documentation: [doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#daemonsets)*

>[!info]
>For specific log collection or monitoring, you may need to run a pod on all nodes or a select set of nodes. You can use DaemonSets to deploy to one or more identical pods. The DaemonSet Controller ensures that each node specified runs an instance of the pod.
>
>The DaemonSet Controller can schedule pods on nodes early in the cluster boot process, before the default Kubernetes scheduler has started. This ability ensures that the pods in a DaemonSet are started before traditional pods in a Deployment or StatefulSet are scheduled.
>
>Like StatefulSets, a DaemonSet is defined as part of a YAML definition using `kind: DaemonSet.`
## CronJob & Jobs

Documentation: [ðŸ”—Click to the link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/)
### Definition

![[k8s-cronjob.png]]

>[!tldr]
><h2> What is cronjobs ? </h2>
>
>A CronJob creates Jobs on a repeating schedule.
>
>CronJob is meant for performing regular scheduled actions such as backups, report generation, and so on. One CronJob object is like one line of a crontab (cron table) file on a Unix system. It runs a Job periodically on a given schedule, written in Cron format.
>
><h2> What is jobs ? </h2>
>A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job is resumed again.
>
>A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot).
>
>You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

### Schedule syntax 

The `.spec.schedule` field is required. The value of that field follows the Cron syntax:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ minute (0 - 59)
â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ hour (0 - 23)
â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of the month (1 - 31)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ month (1 - 12)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚                             OR sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ 
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
* * * * *
```

Other than the standard syntax, some macros like @monthly can also be used:

| Entry                  | Description                                                | Equivalent to |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| @yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year at midnight of 1 January                   | 0 0 1 1 *     |
| @monthly               | Run once a month at midnight of the first day of the month | 0 0 1 * *     |
| @weekly                | Run once a week at midnight on Sunday morning              | 0 0 * * 0     |
| @daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day at midnight                                 | 0 0 * * *     |
| @hourly                | Run once an hour at the beginning of the hour              | 0 * * * *     |
|                        |                                                            |               |

# Storage

![[k8s-storage.png]]

With Kubernetes work on Azure Cloud. Therefore, we need consider what type of storage, cluster can associate

- Azure File
- Azure Disk
- Azure Blob

With Storage on AKS, you need to enable `CSI drive` for using extension storage class above by command or IaC

```bash title="Enable by command"
az aks update -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-disk-driver --enable-file-driver --enable-blob-driver
```

or enable it when provision with `terraform`

```hcl title="Enable by terraform"
resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "this" {
  ...
  ...
  storage_profile {
    blob_driver_enabled         = true
    disk_driver_enabled         = true
    file_driver_enabled         = true
    snapshot_controller_enabled = false
  }
  ...
  ...
}
```

- Not `sticky session` is set on `ingress`, so not concern about that
- The route handle, rule, restrict are setting on `Nginx`, so you need to understand the `nginx` for changing that
- `Nginx-Ingress` deploy via `helm`

![[Pasted image 20240405112238.png]]
## Auto Scaling

For purpose stably infrastructure, AKS can be able to apply

- Apply scale with kind `cluster autoscaler` in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Find more, [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler?tabs=azure-cli)
- Set another scaling range for your node through couple ways

We can apply that via command

```bash title="Use command"
az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --enable-cluster-autoscaler --min-count 1 --max-count 3
```

You can also use Azure portal with choose on `Nodes pool` --> Select node pool want update --> choose `Scale Node Pool`

![[Pasted image 20241221204808.png]]
## Security Patch for OS

For purpose prevent vulnerable, attack for AKS, Security Patch is suggested by Azure. Therefore, All environment is applying this one via command

1. Check the `nodeOsUpgradeChannel` by command `az aks show --resource-group <rg-name> --name <aks-name>  --query autoUpgradeProfile`

	![[Pasted image 20240405113904.png]]
	It contains two optional: `nodeOsUpgradeChannel` (Have purpose to update the security and bugfixes for Node Container Image) and `upgradeChannel` (Have purpose to update the aks cluster - that not recommendation)

2. If null in first option, go through enable feature flag and add the configuration for this stuff. More detail in this link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/auto-upgrade-node-image#register-the-nodeosupgradechannelpreview-feature-flag:~:text=Register%20the%20NodeOsUpgradeChannelPreviewAfter run the command `az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeOsUpgradeChannelPreview"`

	![[Pasted image 20240405113951.png]]
	The feature flag is registering. And after that run the command for confirm the feature `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`

3. After that use this command to create security patch it will create VHD but the cost is footling `az aks update --resource-group <rg-name> --name <aks-name> --node-os-upgrade-channel SecurityPatch` . So for checking go step 1 to print the result of applies.

	![[Pasted image 20240405114036.png]]

4. All thing is done in this lastly, because the update can make the maintance system so it will do on the weekend every 2 week on 11pm saturday. The command for doing that kind is `az aks maintenanceconfiguration add -g <rg-name> --cluster-name <aks-name> --name aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule --interval-weeks 2 --day-of-week Saturday --start-time 16:00 --duration 6 --schedule-type Weekly`. For more detail go this link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/planned-maintenance
   ![[Pasted image 20240405114220.png]]
   That all step to setup mechanism for OS security update. The affect can show on activity log on K8s - Check it for more detail progress update.
## Versioning of AKS

>[!warning]
>If you want to updating version, you can use multiple way from `Azure Portal, Command` but for general, please use **Infrastructure as Code** for upgrading version. More about will relate at [[Awesome Terraform#Example Update the version AKS with Terraform|Update the version AKS with Terraform]]

>[!danger]
>1. Please **consider when update the big version**, some **features can deprecate or remove**. If you want update, please take your time to understanding what happen on next version.
>2. On Azure, you **can't leap upgrade over two version**, for example from 1.27.x to 1.29.x. You **must perform all upgrades sequentially** by major version number
