# CDC Pattern

>[!note]
><h2>What is CDC?</h2>
>
>CDC as a mechanism that constantly monitors the original data system for changes, extracts them, and distributes them to upstream systems. Change Data Capture excludes the process of bulk data loading by implementing incremental loading of data in nearly real-time.
